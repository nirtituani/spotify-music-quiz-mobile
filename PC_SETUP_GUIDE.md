   tar -czf SpotifyMusicQuiz.tar.gz SpotifyMusicQuiz/
   ```

3. **On your PC:**
   - Download the `SpotifyMusicQuiz.tar.gz` file

## üéÆ STEP 6: Run the App!

### Make sure:
- ‚úÖ Android emulator is running (you can see the phone screen)
- ‚úÖ npm install finished successfully
- ‚úÖ Spotify credentials are configured

### Run the app:

**Open TWO Command Prompts:**

**Command Prompt #1 - Start Metro Bundler:**
```cmd
cd C:\Projects\SpotifyMusicQuiz
npm start
```
- This starts the JavaScript bundler
- Keep this window open!
- You'll see: "Welcome to Metro" and some QR code

**Command Prompt #2 - Build and Run Android:**
```cmd
cd C:\Projects\SpotifyMusicQuiz
npm run android
```
- This builds the Android app
- Installs it on the emulator
- Takes 3-5 minutes first time
- You'll see lots of build messages

### If successful:
- The app will open on the emulator! üéâ
- You'll see the login screen with "Login with Spotify" button

---

## ‚ùå Common Problems & Solutions

### "adb not found"
- Close Command Prompt and open a NEW one
- Run: `adb version` to test
- If still fails: Check ANDROID_HOME path

### "SDK location not found"
- Create file: `android/local.properties`
- Add line: `sdk.dir=C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk`
- Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your Windows username

### "Java not found"
- Close Command Prompt and open a NEW one
- Run: `java -version` to test
- If still fails: Check JAVA_HOME path

### "Unable to load script"
- Make sure Metro bundler is running (Command Prompt #1)
- Press 'R' in the emulator to reload

### Build takes forever
- First build takes 5-10 minutes (downloads dependencies)
- Next builds are much faster (30 seconds)

### "No devices found"
- Make sure emulator is running
- In emulator window, you should see a phone screen
- Run: `adb devices` - should show emulator

## üéØ What Happens Next?

Once the app runs:
1. You'll see the **Login Screen**
2. Click "Login with Spotify"
3. **PROBLEM**: The login won't work yet! Why?
   - The OAuth callback needs backend support
   - We need to add an endpoint to your backend
   - I'll help you with this in Step 2!

For now, getting the app to **build and run** is a huge win! üéâ
